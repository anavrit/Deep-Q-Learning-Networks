# Project #1: REPORT

### Learning Algorithm

For this project, I have trained an agent to navigate and collect bananas in a large, square world using deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

Two reinforcement learning algorithms with specific deep learning architectures and hyperparameters were tested. Details are provided below:

#### 1. Deep Q-Network


#### 2. Double Deep Q-Network


### Plot of Rewards



### Ideas for Future Work
